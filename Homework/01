# Programming Assignment 1: Rectangle Calculator

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to practice basic programming concepts by creating a program that calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle. You will need to write a program that prompts the user to input the length and width of a rectangle and then displays the calculated perimeter and area. This assignment is worth **5 points**.

## Instructions

1.  Mimic the code presented in the PowerPoint slides from the lecture.
2.  Your program should ask the user for two pieces of information:
      * The length of the rectangle.
      * The width of the rectangle.
3.  Store the user's input in appropriate variables.
4.  Calculate the **perimeter** of the rectangle using the formula: $$2 \times (length + width)$$5.  Calculate the **area** of the rectangle using the formula:$$length \times width$$
5.  Display the calculated perimeter and area to the user in a clear and easy-to-read format.

## Example Output

Here is an example of what your program's output should look like:

```
Please enter the length of the rectangle: 10
Please enter the width of the rectangle: 5
The perimeter of the rectangle is: 30
The area of the rectangle is: 50
```
